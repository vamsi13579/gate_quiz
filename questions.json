  "text": "In a secure email exchange, Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob. The message is encrypted using Bob's public key, and then Alice signs the encrypted message using her private key. If the public key of Bob is (e_B = 17, n_B = 3233) and the private key of Alice is (d_A = 2753, n_A = 3233), and the resulting ciphertext after encryption and signing is 3210, what is the original plaintext message that Bob will recover after decryption and verification?
