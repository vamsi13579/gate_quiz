  "text": "In a network with 8 hosts connected via point-to-point links to a single store-and-forward bridge, each link has a capacity of 1 Mbps. The bridge has two interfaces: one for incoming frames (from any host) and one for outgoing frames (to any host). A frame of 1000 bits is transmitted on the incoming link, but it is discarded at the bridge due to a checksum error. Assuming the bridge immediately begins retransmitting the same frame after detecting the error, and ignoring any processing delays or propagation delays, what is the total time in milliseconds required for the frame to be successfully transmitted and received on the outgoing link after the error is corrected? Answer: _______",
