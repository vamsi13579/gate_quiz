  "text": "Consider a network topology where two Ethernet LANs, LAN1 and LAN2, are interconnected using a transparent bridge. Host A is on LAN1 and Host B is on LAN2. The bridge uses a learning algorithm to populate its MAC address table. Which of the following statements are TRUE regarding the bridge's behavior and the network's operation? (Select all that apply.)",
  "options": [
    "When Host A initially sends a frame to Host B, the bridge will flood the frame to all ports except the one it was received on.",
    "If Host B responds to Host A, the bridge will learn Host B's MAC address upon receiving the response frame.",
    "The bridge will forward all broadcast frames from LAN1 to LAN2 and vice versa.",
    "If Host A and Host B's MAC addresses are already in the bridge's MAC address table, subsequent unicast frames between them will not be forwarded to the opposite LAN."
